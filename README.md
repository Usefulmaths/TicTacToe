# TicTacToe
This is an implementation of the simple grid-based game known as TicTacToe. Additionally, a simple AI has been created which can serve as a worthy opponent!

A brief description of how this works can be seen in the jupyter notebook `TicTacToe.ipynb`.

You can play against the AI by running the following command: 

`python3 main.py --difficulty 100`

In order to change the difficulty of the opponent, change the value of the `--difficulty` flag.
